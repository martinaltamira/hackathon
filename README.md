# Hackaton App

Who hasnâ€™t attended a hackathon in the past? Those are great opportunities to learn, challenge ourselves and meet new people.
Each hackathon has developers and 3 winners (ranking 1st to 3rd). We will build a system that looks for the best developers around the world by saving from each hackathon the best 10 developments.
